## About my experience

I have worked with Express for almost 6 months and have implemented basic cricket scoring Web app with React, and I have worked for more than 1 year 3 months with React and React-Native.

My overall work experience is 4 years and I have been working as a developer from past 1 years 5 months.

## Description of the problem and solution.

### Problem

Creating a functional dashboard with minimal front-end and backend setup.

### Solution

React frontend and Node.js backend was used in building the solution. Redux store management is used. Simple REST API endpoints are used for the board CRUD operations. Importance has been given to clean frontend code.

#### Details

Frontend - React<br/>

1. As per the UI, the components has been divided accordingly ex: in headers components like `Main Header` `Side Header` and for board seperate `Board Header` is added which increases the reusability of the components wherever necessary.
2. For state mangement `Redux` is used and `Redux Saga` is used as a middleware.

Backend - Node Express<br/>

1. MongoDB from mLab is used to keep the DB side simple
2. Only create, read and update route is done. Which does corresponding actions for the project.

## Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.

1. It is Easy to build and deploy both frontend and backend in Javacript and I have been using Express and React from the begining.
2. And MongoDB is flexible enough to use.

## Trade-offs

1. Keeping time in mind, the importance was shown to write good frontend code & have clean design details in the frontend
2. Complete frontend functionalities & backend features
